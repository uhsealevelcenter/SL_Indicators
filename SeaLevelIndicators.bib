For each station, 95\% exceedance levels for each day of the year are estimated as the superposition of tidal, high frequency (e.g. storms, eddies), and seasonal components. The annual climatologies illustrate the general character of extremes at each site, ranging from locations where extreme occurrences are due primarily to storms, to those where spring tides are the main determining factor. For the latter category of stations, extreme levels tend to cluster around the semi-annual peaks in spring tides. These peaks fall at the equinoxes at stations having a dominant semidiurnal component, and at the solstices at stations with diurnal-dominant tides. The impact of storms is heightened in some locations when seasonal storms arrive during the semiannual maxima in spring tide elevations. A tide model is used to show the semiannual range in solstitial and equinoctial spring tides around the globe.},

This model uses a time-dependent generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution to fit monthly maxima series and is applied to a large historical tidal gauge record (San Francisco, California). The model allows the identification and estimation of the effects of several time scales—such as seasonality, interdecadal variability, and secular trends—in the location, scale, and shape parameters of the probability distribution of extreme sea levels. The inclusion of seasonal effects explains a large amount of data variability, thereby allowing a more efficient estimation of the processes involved. Significant correlation with the Southern Oscillation index and the nodal cycle, as well as an increase of about 20\% for the secular variability of the scale parameter have been detected for the particular dataset analyzed. Results show that the model is adequate for a complete analysis of seasonal-to-interannual sea level extremes providing time-dependent quantiles and confidence intervals.},

A subset of the data was used to study changes over the 20th century. The analyses demonstrate the magnitude and timing of the seasonal cycle of extreme sea level occurrence, the magnitude of long-term trends in extreme sea levels, the evidence for perigean and nodal astronomical tidal components in the extremes, and the relationship of the interannual variability in high water levels to other ocean and atmosphere variations as represented by climate indices. The subtraction from the extreme sea levels of the corresponding annual median sea level results in a reduction in the magnitude of trends at most stations, leading to the conclusion that much of the change in the extremes is due to change in the mean values.},

To quantify the impact of sea level rise on the tendency for flooding events to cluster in future years, we developed a hierarchical statistical model describing the number of days per year for which sea level exceeds a prescribed threshold in Honolulu as a function of annual mean sea level and the amplitude of the highest tides. Based on this model, we generate probabilistic projections of exceedance days per year for the 21st century, which show pronounced inflections in the frequency of exceedance days due to the interaction between sea level rise and long-period (18.6 year) modulation of tidal amplitude. Analysis of the projections demonstrates how planning for the “typical” future year can substantially underestimate flooding impacts during inevitable severe years that experience many more exceedance days than expected in a probabilistic sense. The projections also show the potential for rapid, subdecadal transitions from occasional to chronic threshold exceedance during the second half of the century, suggesting that implementation of adaptation and mitigation strategies may need to begin prior to the emergence of occasional minor impacts in affected areas.},

	doi = {10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0221.1},
	abstract = {Hawaii experienced record-high sea levels during 2017, which followed the 2015 strong El Niño and coincided with weak trade winds in the tropical northeastern Pacific. The record sea levels were associated with a combination of processes, an important contributing factor of which was the persistent high sea level ({\textasciitilde}10 cm above normal) over a large region stretching between Hawaii and Mexico. High sea levels at Mexico are known to occur during strong El Niño as the coastal thermocline deepens. Planetary wave theory predicts that these coastal anomalies propagate westward into the basin interior; however, high sea levels at Hawaii do not occur consistently following strong El Niño events. In particular, Hawaii sea levels remained near normal following the previous strong El Niño of 1997. The processes controlling whether Hawaii sea levels rise after El Niño have so far remained unknown. Atmosphere-forced ocean model experiments show that anomalous surface cooling, controlled by variable trade winds, impacts sea level via mixed layer density, explaining much of the difference in Hawaiian sea level response after the two recent strong El Niño events. In climate model projections with greenhouse warming, more frequent weak trade winds following El Niño events are expected, suggesting that the occurrence of high sea levels at Hawaii will increase as oceanic anomalies more often traverse the basin.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Previous studies have investigated the role of the Pacific meridional mode (PMM), a climate mode of the mid-latitudes in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, in favoring the development of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However little is known on how ENSO can influence the development of the PMM. Here we investigate the relationship between ENSO and the South Pacific Meridional Mode (SPMM) focusing on strong SPMM events that follows strong El Niño events. This type of events represents more than 60\% of such events in the observational record and the historical simulations of the CESM Large ensemble (CESM-LE). It is first shown that such a relationship is rather stationary in both observations and the CESM-LE. Our analyses further reveal that strong SPMM events are associated with a coastal warming off northern central Chile peaking in Austral winter resulting from the propagation of waves forced at the equator during the development of El Niño events. The time delay between the ENSO peak (Boreal winter) and this coastal warming (Austral winter) can be understood in terms of the differential contribution of the equatorially-forced propagating baroclinic waves to the warming along the coast. In particular, the difference in phase speeds of the waves (the high-order mode the wave the slower) implies that they do not overlap along their propagation south of 20°S. This contributes to the persistence of warm coastal SST anomalies off Central Chile until the Austral summer following the concurrent El Niño event. This coastal warming is favorable to the development of strong SPMM events as the South Pacific Oscillation become active during that season. The analysis of the simulations of the Coupled Intercomparison Project phases 5 and 6 (CMIP5/6) indicates that very few models realistically simulate this ENSO/SPMM relationship and associated oceanic teleconnection.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Regional frequency analysis (RFA) can reduce uncertainties in the estimations of return levels, provided that homogeneous regions can be delineated. In the framework of extreme marine events, a physically based method to form homogeneous regions by identifying typical storms footprints is proposed. First, a spatiotemporal declustering procedure is employed to detect storms generating marine extremes. Second, the identification of the most typical storms footprints relies on a clustering algorithm based on a criterion of storm propagation. The resulting regions are readily explicable: sites from a given region are likely to be impacted by the same storms, and any storm impacting a region is likely to remain enclosed in this region. This procedure is fairly simple to implement, as the only information required is the time of occurrence of the observed extremes. An application to the estimation of extreme significant wave heights from the numerical sea-state database ANEMOC-2 is given. Six regions, both physically and statistically homogeneous, are delineated in the North-East part of the Atlantic Ocean. It is shown that the identification of storms footprints allows the increase of the overall statistical homogeneity. Combined with RFA, the proposed method highlights regional differences in the spatial extent and intensity of storms.},

Hierarchical models based on the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution are useful since they may combine scaling properties and distinct degrees of pooling in the shape parameter for improving quantile estimation. In this paper, we evaluate the benefits of combining a partial pooling approach and a formal description of the spatial latent processes that govern the distribution parameters. The application of the model in the Alto do São Francisco River catchment (Brazil) suggests that, despite obtaining similar estimates at gauged sites, prediction at ungauged counterparts may be substantially improved in densely gauged regions, in terms of accuracy and precision, by accounting for spatial dependency. In poorly gauged areas, however, no benefits in utilizing latent spatial processes for inference were verified.},

	abstract = {Sea level rise is increasing the frequency of coastal flooding globally, and low-lying communities are particularly vulnerable. We present an assessment of historical and projected changes in coastal flooding in 11 Pacific small-island nations, using tide gauge data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. We derive impact-, event- and percentile-based thresholds to calculate historical exceedance frequencies. Projections of future exceedance frequencies are then made using the recent suite of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) emission scenarios (Sixth Assessment Report). We find that exceedances of the percentile thresholds have increased in the last decade at all locations, with sites seeing exceedances in months where exceedances were previously rare or unseen in the sea level record. In the future, daily threshold exceedances occur after 50–115cm of sea level rise, depending on location. Such levels are currently projected to be reached between 2080 and 2130 according to high emissions scenario SSP5–8.5. Low emissions scenario, SSP1–1.9, shows sea level rise resulting in 25–75days of exceedances by 2050 for the 11 locations. This increased frequency of coastal flooding highlights the changing nature of coastal flood risk in the Pacific, with extreme weather and wave events being increasingly unnecessary for inundation to occur. Further, this work highlights how underlying increases in coastal flooding frequency pose a growing risk of exacerbating inundation associated with extreme weather or waves. Better flood monitoring and reporting will improve the accuracy of impact thresholds, strengthening the relevance of the results presented here for coastal emergency and planning managers.},

	abstract = {AbstractHourly time series from a quasi-global set of 145 tide gauges are used to investigate annual maximum water levels at each station. High water levels are deconstructed into (1) a predicted tidal component, (2) a seasonal component, (3) a low-frequency nontidal residual that accounts for sea level variability at time scales greater than a month but less than a year, and (4) a high-frequency nontidal residual that captures variability particularly associated with storms at time scales greater than a month. The time-averaged annual maximum water level correlates significantly with, and scales as 2.5 times, the water level standard deviation at the tide gauge stations. This relationship is used to estimate time-averaged annual maximum water level on a nearly continuous global scale (excluding ice-covered polar regions) by specifying variance maps of the tides from a tide model, the seasonal and low-frequency residual components from satellite altimetry sea surface height, and the high-frequency residual component from an atmospheric reanalysis product. The variance fields are combined to estimate time-averaged annual maximum water levels that compare well with observed values at the tide gauge stations. Spatial patterns of annual maximum water levels and relative contributions from the tides and nontidal residual components are considered.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Satellite altimetry measurements of sea surface height provide near‐global ocean state observations on sub‐monthly time scales, which are not always utilized by seasonal climate forecasting systems. As early as the mid‐1990s, attempts were made to assimilate altimetry observations to initialize climate models. These experiments demonstrated improved ocean forecasting skill, especially compared to experiments that did not assimilate subsurface ocean temperature information. Nowadays, some operational climate forecasting models utilize altimetry in their assimilation systems, whereas others do not. Here, we assess the impact of altimetry assimilation on seasonal prediction skill of ocean variables in two climate forecasting systems that are from the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (SEAS5) and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (ACCESS‐S). We show that assimilating altimetry improves the initialization of subsurface ocean temperatures, as well as seasonal forecasts of monthly variability in upper‐ocean heat content and sea level. Skill improvements are largest in the subtropics, where there are typically less subsurface ocean observations available to initialize the forecasts. In the tropics, there are no noticeable improvements in forecast skill. The positive impact of altimetry assimilation on forecast skill related to the subsurface ocean does not seem to affect predictions of sea surface temperature. Whether this is because current forecasting systems are close to the potential predictability limit for the ocean surface, or perhaps altimetry observations are not fully exploited, remains a question. In summary, we find that utilizing altimetry observations improves the overall global ocean forecasting skill, at least for upper‐ocean heat content and sea level.
          , 
            Plain Language Summary
            Sea surface heights have been nearly continuously and globally measured by satellite‐based altimeters for almost 30 years, yet not all climate models utilize these observations during their initialization phases of seasonal forecasting. Since the local sea surface height (SSH), or sea level, is mostly determined by the ocean temperature and salinity‐controlled subsurface density structure, the altimetry measurements contain a vast amount of integrated information about the ocean climate state. Climate forecasting systems are usually most skillful when they start from the most accurate initial conditions, including the state of the ocean density structure. Unfortunately, temperature and salinity observations are sparse in many parts of the world's oceans, which degrades the initialization of models and thus possibly diminishes forecast skill. Here, we quantify the benefits of using altimetry observations to initialize two state‐of‐the‐art climate forecasting systems by verifying seasonal forecasts using observational products of upper‐ocean temperature, sea surface temperature, and SSH. In the experiments that did not use altimetry data assimilation, we find an overall decrease of seasonal forecasting skill for the subsurface temperature and SSH, which is especially pronounced in the global subtropics, although we find no widespread change in skill for sea surface temperature. Thus, for predicting the subsurface ocean, climate forecasting systems may benefit from incorporating altimetry data assimilation into their ocean initial conditions. More work is needed to assess how much of the subsurface skill improvements can potentially affect the surface ocean.

This is critical for urban O’ahu, where infrastructure is on low-lying coastal areas with varying sedimentary consolidation. Here we processed Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data from 2006–2024 for the Hawaiian Islands, referencing them with Global Navigation Satellite System measurements to calculate subsidence rates. We also created a two-meter resolution digital elevation model for coastal O’ahu using 2007–2013 Federal Light Detection and Ranging data, which included hydro-enforcement and gap filling with reprocessed data. Using this elevation data and vertical land motion measurements, we numerically modeled flood exposure. Results suggest that while island-wide subsidence on O’ahu is about 0.6 ± 0.6 mm/yr, the south shore has localized rates exceeding 25.0 ± 1.0 mm/yr. This subsidence, which is much faster than Hawaii’s long-term sea level rise rate (1.54 mm/yr since 1905), could expand flood exposure by up to 53\% by 2050 in the Mapunapuna industrial region. Accounting for subsidence compresses the timeline for flood preparedness by up to 50 years, emphasizing the need to integrate these insights into planning and policy for sustainable development and flood mitigation.},

We find that while RMSL rise generally explains {\textgreater} 84\% of long-term increases in HTF days locally, spatial patterns in HTF changes also depend on differences in flooding thresholds and water level characteristics. Vertical land motion dominates long-term increases in HTF, particularly in the northeast, while sterodynamic sea level (SDSL) is most important elsewhere and on shorter temporal scales. We also show that the recent SDSL acceleration in the Gulf of Mexico has led to an increase of 220\% in the frequency of HTF events over the last decade.},

	abstract = {El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is often characterized through the use of sea surface temperature (SST) departures from their climatological values, as in the Niño-3.4 index. However, this approach is problematic in a changing climate when the climatology itself is varying. To address this issue, van Oldenborgh et al. proposed a relative Niño-3.4 SST index, which subtracts the tropical mean SST anomaly from the Niño-3.4 index and multiplies by a scaling factor. We extend their work by providing a simplified calculation procedure for the scaling factor, and confirm that the relative index demonstrates reduced sensitivity to climate change and multidecadal variability. In particular, we show in three observational SST datasets that the relative index provides a more consistent classification of historical El Niño and La Niña oceanic conditions that is more robust across climatological periods compared to the nonrelative index. Forecast skill of the relative Niño-3.4 index in the North American Multimodel Ensemble (NMME) and ACCESS-S2 is slightly reduced for targets during the first half of the year because subtracting the tropical mean removes a source of additional skill. For targets in the second half of the year, the relative and nonrelative indices are equally skillful. Observed ENSO teleconnections in 200-hPa geopotential height and precipitation during key seasons are sharper and explain more variability over Australia and the contiguous United States when computed with the relative index. Overall, the relative Niño-3.4 index provides a more robust option for real-time monitoring and forecasting ENSO in a changing climate. Significance Statement The goal of this study is to further explore a relative sea surface temperature index for monitoring and prediction of El Niño–Southern Oscillation. Sea surface temperature indices are typically computed as a difference from a 30-yr climatological average, and El Niño and La Niña events occur when values exceed a certain threshold. This method is suitable when the climate is stationary. However, because of climate change and other lower-frequency variations, historical El Niño and La Niña events are reclassified depending on which climatological period is selected. A relative index is investigated to ameliorate this problem.},

The eddy propagated from approximately 3,000 km to the east over a one- to two-year period. Although eddies of this size are not uncommon at Hawaii, the September 2003 sea level was extreme because the eddy coincided with high periods in both the seasonal and decadal cycles, and because sea level at Honolulu has been rising at ∼1.5 cm/decade for the past century.

To achieve this, the smartphone Signal to Noise Ratio-derived heights are contrasted with the heights acquired from a co-located tide gauge of the Argentine Naval Hydrographic Service. A novel methodology is applied to obtain the water levels from the smartphone observations by identifying density maximums in reflections calculated using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. The density maximums are obtain using LOWESS regression, generating a water level series sampled every 5 min referenced to the Chart Datum. Water levels were calculated for 97.7\% of the time, exhibiting a standard deviation of 0.042 m against tide gauge observations. Differences between the daily (monthly) mean levels of the analyzed series showed a standard deviation of 0.016 m (0.007 m), and the amplitude differences for the tidal harmonic constituents were smaller than 0.011 m. While the results found in this work show that these devices cannot compete with traditional tide gauges, they can complement them or be used independently to monitor water level changes in regions where installing and maintaining conventional tide gauges is challenging.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate that long-term tidally induced changes in extreme sea levels affect estimates of major flood hazard in a predictable way. Long-term variations in tides due to the 4.4 and 18.6-year cycles influence extreme sea levels at 380 global tide gauges out of a total of 581 analyzed. Results show coherent regions where the amplitudes of the modulations are particularly relevant in the 100-year return sea level, reaching more than 20 cm in some regions (western Europe, north Australia, and Singapore). We identify locations that are currently in a positive phase of the modulation and therefore at a higher risk of flooding, as well as when (year) the next peak of the long-term tidal modulations is expected to occur. The timing of the peak of the modulation is spatially coherent and influenced by the relative importance of each cycle (4.4 or 18.6-year) over the total amplitude. An evaluation of four locations suggests that the potentially flooded area in a 100-year event can vary up to ∼45\% (in Boston) as a result of the long-term tidal cycles; however, the flooded area varies due to local topography and tidal characteristics (6\%–13\%). We conclude that tidally modulated changes in extreme sea levels can alter the potentially inundated area in a 100-year event and that the traditional, fixed 100-year floodplain is inadequate for describing coastal flood risk, even without considering sea-level rise.},

	abstract = {High-tide flooding (HTF) is usually generated by a variety of different processes acting at different temporal scales across different geographic regions, but little is known about the role of interactions between those. We assess the role of compounding effects arising from cross-covariances between different sea-level components in generating HTF events along the US coastline. Our results show that compounding effects contribute to both HTF frequencies and magnitudes. The US Gulf and northwest coasts exhibit particularly high potential for compound HTF. Long-term sea-level rise is the main driver of accelerated HTF frequencies along the US coastline. However, even in the absence of sea-level rise, changes in compounding effects due to increased or decreased cross-covariances between sea-level components associated with climate variability and change also modulate compound HTF. Our results highlight the importance of adequately modeling compounding effects between sea-level components when generating future projections of HTF.},

	abstract = {Sea level data from a set of 141 tide gauges with a reasonable global distribution have been used to seek evidence for significant changes during recent decades in the occurrence of extreme high-water levels, and for systematic differences between changes in high waters and mean sea levels. The relationships between the occurrence of extreme high waters and of indices of regional climate have also been investigated. It is found that there is indeed evidence for a general worldwide increase in extreme high-water levels since 1975, and that the variations in extremes in this period are closely related to changes in regional climate. However, for most of the stations in the dataset used here, the secular changes and the interannual variability in extremes are similar to those in mean sea level. Consequently, changes in both sea level parameters are consistent with being produced by the same type of atmospheric and/or oceanic forcing.},
