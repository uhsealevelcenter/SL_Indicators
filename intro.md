Coastal flooding takes many forms, ranging from major flooding associated with strong storms (surge and heavy rains) to minor flooding associated with sea level rise, seasonal high tides, and typical winds and ocean current variability on storm‐free days. Impacts are growing, and with rising sea levels, over the coming decades coastal flooding in all its forms will have significantly increased impacts on built and natural systems.

The primary objective of this repository of open-source computer code assets (i.e., documented Jupyter notebooks on GitHub) is to provide a set of baseline water level climatologies and associated indicators products that can be used to support coastal flood monitoring, prediction, and reporting. By providing these codes, we hope to enhance the ability of policy and decision-makers to use this information, by helping to ensure that content and format are consistent across multiple dissemination platforms.

This prototype jupyter book is made for sea level indicators of the Hawaiian Island region using either hourly tide gauge data from the [UHSLC database](https://uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu/data/) or [NOAA CO-OPS](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/). To (visually) navigate through the products generated by these notebooks, visit [The Matrix](https://uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu/jfiedler/SeaLevelIndicators/).
