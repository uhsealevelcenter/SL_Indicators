    "In this notebook, we'll examine the various contributions to extreme sea levels through the lens of the nonstationary GEV analysis. Inspiration for these plots and analysis follows from {cite:t}`marra_advancing_2023` and {cite:t}`sweet_implications_2024`, which use the nonstationary GEV analysis of {cite:t}`mendez_analyzing_2007` to analyze the influence of climatic patterns like ENSO and PDO (for example) on extreme sea levels. This notebook changes only one aspect of the method - allowing for a lagged covariate in the nonstationary GEV model.  \n",
