    "As with our stationary annual extremes, for the nonstationary extremes we'll be using the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. This time, however, we allow for a time-dependent distribution, meaning that our extremes will vary from year to year (see figure). The GEV is a family of continuous probability distributions developed to combine the Gumbel, Fréchet, and Weibull families, also known as type I, II, and III extreme value distributions, respectively. It is widely used in different fields, particularly for modeling the largest or smallest values among a large set of independent, identically distributed random values (extreme value analysis).\n",

    "- $ \\psi $ (scale parameter) is strictly positive and scales the distribution.\n",

    "Assuming we are not dealing with a random stationary process (as with our stationary annual extremes), each parameter in the above equation can be the combination of one or more time-dependent components. These effects could include annual variability (seasonality), sea level rise (long-term trend and possible acceleration), a long-term trend for the extreme values, long-term climate variability effects explained by climate indices or the 18.61-yr nodal cycle.\n",

Because there are so many parameters to estimate (a high-dimensional problem), a Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE-UA,\\cite{Duan}) optimization scheme is used to determine the best parameter fits. The SCE-UA is used often in hydrology, engineering, and other environmental sciences, using random clusters for initial starting points in its search algorithm and allowing them to \"evolve\" to a better solution.

This corresponds to a 2-month return level, and makes sense if you are looking at each month in isolation (every other year the value is exceeded). This is the case in Méndez et al 2007 (and following papers), and likely comes down to an interpretation of what this line is actually meant to portray. Accounting for the fact that you are sampling monthly data moves the within-a-year return level up to more closely align with the 'stationary' solid line (and the sinusoid formed by the seasonal cycle then varies about the stationary return level). (Julia's opinion here): because this plot is dimensionless (time goes from 0 to 1), we must normalize our data by removing the time component. In this case, the time element is the monthly sampling, so we must scale our probabilities accordingly by (1/12). \n",

The return levels (at 2, 10, 50, and 100 year levels) are shown in solid lines. The 95% Confidence Interval (shaded area) also varies in time, and is shown only for the 2 and 10 year return levels. Years 2008 and 2020 are highlighted on these curves to show the differences in values when taking seasonality, a long-term trend, and the 18.6 nodal-cycle into account. This particular best-fit model for {glue:text}`station_name` includes the {glue:text}`parameters_included`. Note we have not included the perigean cycle in this model.
