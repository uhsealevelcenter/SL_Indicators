    "A climatology of extreme sea levels at the Honolulu tide gauge. Monthly maxima (+), determined from hourly sea level data, are shown from 1993-2024. The solid line corresponds to projected sea level return levels at 2,10,50 and 100 years, using this 30-year chunk of data. This line uses a nonstationary GEV to take the seasonal variations of sea level into account. The 2, 10, 50 and 100-year return levels are shown to vary throughout the year (dashed line), with the lowest extremes occuring in March, and highest extremes peaking in July. No long-term trend is used in this model, and the scale and location parameters are held constant.\n",
